Hi there! This is Han Xie. I am currently a final-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Emory University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Profs. [Carl Yang](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~jyang71/) and [Li Xiong](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~lxiong/). I have also been working closely with [Prof. Salman Avestimehr's group](https://www.avestimehr.com/vital-lab) on federated learning with graph data. My research interests include trustworthy machine learning, graph machine learning, large language models, and AI for healthcare.


Prior to joining Emory, I obtained my master's and bachelor's degrees at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) and [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://english.hust.edu.cn/), respectively. I also spent a great semester in my senior year at [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/).
